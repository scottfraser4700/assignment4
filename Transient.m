%% Section 2 - Transient Circuit Simulation
% In this section, we use a finite difference approach to numerically
% simulate the time domain response of the circuit analyzed in the previous
% section. The circuit is a low pass filter/amplifier. It comes with an expected
% frequency response of high gain for low frequency inputs, and a rolloff
% in gain for frequencies above its corner frequency.
